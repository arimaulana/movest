# Movest - a movie festival app

A software developer contractor is looking to build a team to develop an app for a short
movie festival.

Before the festival, an admin will manually collect movie files from invited participants. The
admin will then upload the movie files and add relevant movie attributes (title, etc) through
CMS, and the admin is also able to update the entry if necessary.

During the festival, everyone who installed the app can search and view the uploaded
movies. Everytime someone sees a movie, itâ€™s counted as 1 view for the movie.

Some users can register and login to the system. These authenticated users can vote for a
movie that they like, with limitation that 1 user can only vote for the same movie once.
However, an authenticated user can vote for multiple movies that they like, and they also
can unvote a movie if they changed their mind later.

After the festival finishes, the admin can see which movies are the most popular (have the
most viewership) and which movies are the most liked (have the most votes).
They already have front-end developers, and now they approached you to help them to
create the backend side of the system.
